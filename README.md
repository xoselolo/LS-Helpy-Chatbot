## Reason

This project has been created for Knowledge Based Systems of LaSalle University in Barcelona. The objective of the project was to create a chatbot.

## Our Chatbot

Our chatbot name is LSHelpy, and it's useful to students of LaSalle to build their schedules at the end of a course and starting another one. The student can be provided by information about subjects such as (the number of credits the subject has, what type of subject is, and for sure the hours per week).

## Objective

The final step of our chatbot may be the construction of a schedule and a download of it in the student cell.
